# PROBLEM: Threats in worker's safety at construction site

# APPROACH: Reinforcement learning model - PPO & combination of hybrid model - transfer learning, deep neural network

Framework: OpenAI GYM, Tensorflow, PYTorch, Baseline

Input data: Aerial imagery data by drone surevy at construction sites

Workflow: The proposed hybrid model works on sequenced decision making manner which is capable of detecting & Reasoning risks for workers in the construction site. The computation was made into episodes which process as set of actionable outcomes(class) and critics(Value). 

Possiblity of risk: Working without safety equipment

Equipments: HardHat, Vest, Googles, Ear muffs, welding Face shield and Gloves 


***The project is inspired and made in a way to protect our ground workers who work for our betterment life and well-being***
